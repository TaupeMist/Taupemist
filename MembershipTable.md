# Taupemist Membership Table v1.0

Taupemist is a non-profit organisation and the only expense incurred by members is in the form of a fair community decided unbiased fee paid directly to Taupemist members as a means of compensation for the time and resources they require to provide a service or product.

The Taupemist ( TM ) digital asset serves as a utility token and amount of TM held within a member's account denotes the level of access that Taupemist members have to the Taupemist organisation's present and future, products and services.
